PRK Firmware 0.9.20 (20221226 revision ac04670)

Welcome to PRK Firmware!

Usage:
- Drag and drop your `keymap.rb` into this directory
- Then, your keyboard will be automatically rebooted. That's all!

Notice:
- Make sure you always have a backup of your `keymap.rb`
  because upgrading prk_firmware-*.uf2 will remove it from flash
